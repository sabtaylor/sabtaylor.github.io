           <p>My name is Sabrina Taylor, and I am a junior undergraduate student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am originally from Los Angeles, California, where I have lived all my life. I am currently pursuing a degree in English with a specialization in <a href="http://www.umass.edu/pwtc/#"> Professional Writing and Technical Communication (PWTC)</a>, as well as a minor in Information Technology (IT). Alongside being a full-time student, I currently work as a web developer for UMass Amherst's radio station, WMUA 91.1 FM. Once I graduate, I plan on pursuing a career in technical writing and/or user experience (UX). Over the last few years, I have gained experience with Python, HTML/CSS, MadCap Flare, Microsoft Word/Excel, Adobe Photoshop/InDesign/Lightroom, and Stencyl. <br>  When I am not writing essays or documentation, I love swimming, playing videogames on my Nintendo Switch, photographing, and hosting my radio show on WMUA 91.1 FM (Keep Bouncing on Thursdays 1-2:30 PM, <a href="https://player.fastcast4u.com/qernhlca/"> tune in)!</a></p>
