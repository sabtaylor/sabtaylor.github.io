        <p> <a class="button" href="pdf/lcmsmanual.pdf">Legislative Consituent Management Sytem (LCMS) Manual (PDF)</a> <br>
        
        This 9-page manual is a guide for a government content-management system (CMS) which serves to record and store constituent information such as basic contact information, positions on bills, and any interactions or casework that a consituent has been involved with. I completed this project during a summer internship I had in 2017, in which a field representative put me in charge of creating an office manual that would help the field workers and interns alike learn how to complete any of the basic or complex tasks that LCMS provided. This guide serves as a manual for office members within the 46th California Assembly District under Assemblymember Adrin Nazarian, as it has login information and tips that are specific to this government office in particular.

        <p> <a class="button" href="pdf/wordmanual.pdf">Microsoft Word User Focus Manual (PDF)</a> <br>
            
        This 24-page manual was a final project for my English 380 class, Intermediate Technical Writing, which focused on providing a guide to navigating Microsoft Word 2016 for students in the Public Health and Health Sciences field. In this manual, I provide instructions for tasks that can be performed in Microsoft Word which would best serve particular projects and documents that students within the study of health sciencs would be assigned.

        <p> <a class="button" href="pdf/grantproposal.pdf">Urban Gardening Grant Proposal (PDF)</a> <br>
        
            This 20-page grant proposal is requesting a grant in the amount of $15,000 from the Food and Farms Communication Fund for the implementation and first school year of operation of a Youth for Urban Gardening Outreach Program for the organization <a href = "http://www.gardeningthecommunity.org/">Gardening the Community</a>. In this proposed program, I am seeking funding to organize a street team for Gardening the Community, which will function as a youth outreach program across public schools in Springfield focused on educating students K-12 about sustainable practices, food insecurity, and opportunities for urban gardening including the establishment of a community garden in many of the visited schoolgrounds.

        <p> <a class="button" href="pdf/researchpaperdocplan.pdf">English 382 Research Paper (PDF)</a> <br>
        
        This research paper is a current long-term assignment for my English 382 class, Advanced Technical Writing II, in which I plan on writing a paper that confronts the very new and emerging issue of artificial intelligence and its role in creating a new wave of institutionalized racism through certain computer algorithms created by human beings with subjective inherent biases. This paper is a final assignment for the class, and therefore is in the process of being completed. Until completion, I am providing the documentation plan that I have outlined for this research paper.
