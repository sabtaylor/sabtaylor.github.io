       <p>Welcome to my web portfolio!</p> 
          
          
       <p>This is a web page that will be dedicated to my school and career work, and will function as a space for me to share my resume, writing and tech work samples, and contact information for any potential employers (tell your friends). For now, I will only have information about me up, but stay tuned as this web page will be continuously updated over the next few months with more content. Enjoy!</p>

       <img src="images/profilephoto.jpg" alt="A photograph taken of me on a roof">
       
       <p>My name is Sabrina Taylor, and I am currently a junior undergraduate student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am pursuing a degree in English with a specialization in Professional Writing and Technical Communication (PWTC), as well as a minor in Information Technology (IT). </p>

       <p>I have experience in Python, HTML/CSS, MadCap Flare, Microsoft Word/Excel, Stencyl, and Adobe Lightroom.</p>

       <p>When I am not writing essays or documentation, I love swimming, playing videogames on my computer or Nintendo Switch, photographing, and hosting my radio show on WMUA 91.1 FM! (Keep Bouncing on Thursdays 1-2:30 PM, <a href="https://player.fastcast4u.com/qernhlca/"> tune in!)</a></p>
