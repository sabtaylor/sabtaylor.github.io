            <p>
                For this client site, I plan on creating a webpage for UMass students, faculty, and visitors of the university to turn to as a source for unique tips and advice that is provided by current UMass students and/or alumni. <br> 
            </p>
                
            <p>This webpage would include a directory to "life hack" categories that will include:
                
                <ul> 
                    <li>On Campus Living
                    <li>Off Campus Living
                    <li>Dining
                    <li>Du Bois Down-Low
                    <li>Hidden Gemss
                </ul>
        
        <h2>Idea #2: UMass Co-Ops</h2>

            <p>
                For this client site, I plan on creating a directory for all UMass affiliated co-ops that currently operate. As of right now, there is a webpage for each of these co-ops indivudally. However, it could be beneficial for both students searching for these co-ops, as well as for the student-run businesses themselves, if there was a general page that helped more conveniently direct people to all of the student businesses on campus. 
            </p>
    
            <p>
                This webpage will contain:
                
                <ul>
                    <li> Home Page

                            <li>"How to Get Involved"

                For this client site, I plan on creating a webpage for my coworker's arts and crafts business, Button Bento. It is a very new project that she began about half a year back that provides custom-made buttons and/or is available for hiring at events, so creating her own webpage can help her reach out to more people in or near Western Massachusetts for business. <br>
