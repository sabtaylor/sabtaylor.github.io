       <p>My name is Sabrina Taylor, and I am currently a junior undergraduate student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am pursuing a degree in English with a specialization in Professional Writing and Technical Communication (PWTC), as well as a minor in Information Technology (IT). </p>

       <p>I have experience in Python, HTML/CSS, MadCap Flare, Microsoft Word/Excel, Stencyl, and Adobe Lightroom.</p>

       <p>When I am not writing essays or documentation, I love swimming, playing videogames on my computer or Nintendo Switch, photographing, and hosting my radio show on WMUA 91.1 FM! (Keep Bouncing on Thursdays 1-2:30 PM, <a href="https://player.fastcast4u.com/qernhlca/"> tune in!)</a></p>
