      <h1>Hi Everyone!</h1>

       <p>Welcome to my web portfolio!</p> 
       
       <p>This is a web page that will be dedicated to my school and career work, and will function as a space for me to share my <a href="exercise2.html"> resume</a>, writing and tech work samples, and contact information for any potential employers (tell your friends). For now, I will only have information about me up, but stay tuned as this web page will be continuously updated over the next few months with more content. Enjoy!</p>
